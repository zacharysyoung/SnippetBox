# Let's Go: SnippetBox

## Ch 2

- Initialized Go module, Git

- From "Header canonicalization", HTTP/1 allows for bumpy-case header keys, and Go wants to follow this convention (CanonicalMIMEHeaderKey()).  To get past this update the header map directly (e.g., `w.Header()["X-XSS-Protection"] = []string{"1; mode=block"}`, otherwise Go would convert to X-Xss-Protection).

    HTTP/2 requires the server respond will all lowercase, and Go enforces this regardless of direct manipulation.

- Handlers satisfy the http.Handler interface, which has the sole method ServeHTTP(ResponseWriter, *Request).

    ```go
    type home struct {}

    func (h *home) ServeHTTP(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        ...
    }

    ...

    mux := http.NewServerMux()
    mux.Handle("/", &home{})
    ```

    is equivalent to what we currently have:

    ```go
    mux := http.NewServerMux()
    mux.HandleFunc("/", home)
    ```

    where home is an actual Handler functionâ€”internally, mux.HandleFunc just wraps home, like HandlerFunc(home), to generate something (?) with the ServeHTTP method.
